### <h1>ðŸ‘‹Hi there</h1>
Hi, my name is Jonas and I am a Computer Science student in my final semester. I have experience in web development with React and Java, having participated in several academic and professional projects. I am fascinated by technology and innovation and I always try to learn new skills and tools.
### <h1>ðŸ“– Expertise</h1>
My programming journey began during my Computer Science degree, where I was introduced to several programming languages, including Java. That's when I discovered my passion for web development and started exploring more about front-end and back-end.

On the front-end, I started learning React, a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. Through several freelance projects, I gained practical experience in creating reusable components, managing states and props, and implementing routes using React Router. I also became familiar with using additional libraries such as Redux for state management and Axios for API calls.

On the back-end, I deepened my knowledge of Java, learning about concepts such as encapsulation, inheritance and polymorphism. I also explored frameworks like Spring Boot, which allowed me to create robust and scalable web applications. I learned how to integrate SQL and NoSQL databases into my applications and how to implement authentication and authorization using JWT.

Although I have no formal professional experience, I have completed several freelance projects that have allowed me to apply and hone my skills. I'm always looking for new opportunities to learn and grow as a developer.
